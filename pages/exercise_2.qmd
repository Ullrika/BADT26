### Background 

Conjugate models are very useful even today. 

### Task

We have prepared some examples where we want to you use conjugate models to identify which of them that has a conflict between prior and data 

Use conjugate models to construct probability intervals for the results from a clinical trial and compare to a published meta-analysis

Test an hypothesis using conjugate model. How sensitive is the conclusion from the choice of prior?
